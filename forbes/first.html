          <p>Lets take a look at the various metrics for each company in the top 500 list. </p>
          <p>On this page we are plotting the various metrics like Market Value, Assets, Sales and Profits for each company along the Y-axis. The companies are sorted along the x-axis according to its rank.</p>
          <p>In general the overall values seem correlated with the company rank giving a hint that the scores for each of the category are combined in a linear fashion to arrive at the final rank.</p>
          <p>Although we see some spikes for some attributes for some companies ranked slightly lower but thats because they didn't fair well in the remaining categories</p>
